      Interactions between motor behavior & episodic memory
    Series of novel online experiments revealing that engaging in well-learned actions
    during learning improves long-term memory.
    
    key tools & methods: R, statistical analysis, data visualization, online experimentation, dashboarding
  
  
      Exposure to novelty in everyday life boots long-term memory
    Intensive longitudinal survey study demonstrating that doing new things as part of everyday life — going to new places, talking to new people — has strong and widespread benefits for autobiographical memory."
